Q1. What is a tuple in Python?
A tuple is an ordered and immutable sequence of elements in Python. It is similar to a list, but unlike lists, tuples cannot be modified once they are created. Tuples are often used to group related data together in a single object.

Q2. How do you create a tuple in Python?
To create a tuple in Python, you can enclose a comma-separated sequence of elements in parentheses (). For example:

Q3. What is the difference between a tuple and a list in Python?
The main differences between tuples and lists in Python are:

Tuples are immutable, while lists are mutable. Once a tuple is created, you cannot modify its contents. Lists, on the other hand, can be modified by adding, removing, or changing elements.
Tuples use less memory than lists. Since tuples are immutable, Python can allocate memory more efficiently for tuples than for lists.
Tuples are usually used for fixed-size collections of related items, while lists are used for collections that can grow or shrink in size.

Q4. Can a tuple be changed in Python?
No, a tuple cannot be changed in Python once it is created. This means that you cannot add, remove, or modify elements of a tuple. However, you can create a new tuple based on an existing tuple by concatenating tuples or slicing tuples.

Q5. How do you access elements in a tuple?
You can access individual elements in a tuple using square brackets [] and the index of the element you want to access. The index starts from 0 for the first element in the tuple. For example:

Q6. How do you unpack a tuple in Python?
You can unpack a tuple in Python by assigning its elements to separate variables.
